# Sample Spring Boot Application

This is a sample Java / Maven / Spring Boot application that can be used as a starter. I hope it helps you.
Spring Boot is an "opinionated" application bootstrapping framework that makes it easy to create new RESTful services (among other types of applications). It provides many of the usual Spring facilities that can be configured easily usually without any XML.

The project is based on a small web service which uses the following technologies:
- Java 1.8
- Spring MVC with Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL Database 
- Maven
